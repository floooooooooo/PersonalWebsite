            <h3>Customer and contract data</h3>

            <p>We collect, process and use personal data only insofar as this is necessary for the performance of a contract
                or precontractual measures (in accordance with Article 6 (1) (b) GDPR).</p>

                to the bank responsible for processing the payment. A further transmission of the data does not take place
                or only if you have expressly consented to the transmission. A transfer of your data to third parties without

            <h3> Matomo for analysis and tracking
            </h3>
            <p> Our website uses Matomo (formerly "PIWIK"). This is an open source software with which we can analyze the use
                of our website.
            </p>
            <p> In this case, your IP address, previously anonymised to 2 bytes, in order to make it impossible to assign you
                to the Internet connection you are using, the type of browser you are using and the browser version, operating
                system, country of origin, date and time you are using the server request, the number of visits, your length
                of stay on the site and the external links you have stored and processed on a server in Germany. There is
                no disclosure of this data to third parties.
            </p>
            <p> The legal basis is Article 6 (1) (f) GDPR. Our legitimate interest lies in the analysis and optimization of our
                website.
            </p>
            <p> To record this data Matomo stores a cookie on your device via your Internet browser. This cookie is valid for
                one week. For more information, see "Cookies".
            </p>

            <p> Users can object to the anonymized data collection by the program Matomo at any time with effect for the future
                by clicking on the link below. In this case, a so-called opt-out cookie is stored in your browser, with the
                result that Matomo no longer collects session data. When users delete their cookies, the opt-out cookie is
                also deleted and must be reactivated by the users.

            <h2>Google Web Fonts</h2>

            <p> This site uses so-called web fonts, provided by Google, for the uniform representation of fonts. When you call
                up a page, your browser loads the required web fonts into your browser cache to display texts and fonts correctly.
            </p>

            <p> To do this, the browser you use must connect to Google's servers. As a result, Google learns that our website
                has been accessed via your IP address. The use of Google Web Fonts is in the interest of a consistent and
                attractive presentation of our online services. This constitutes a legitimate interest within the meaning
                of Article 6 (1) (f) GDPR.
            </p>
            <p> If your browser does not support web fonts, a default font will be used by your computer.
            </p>

            <p> More information about Google Web Fonts can be found at https://developers.google.com/fonts/faq and in Google's
                Privacy Policy: https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/.</p>

            <h3> Change of our privacy policy</h3>
